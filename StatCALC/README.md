# Britannia Secondary School Capstone Project: StatCALC
StatCALC is a program that calculates discrete probability distributions for users. 

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
StatCALC is meant to be a practice project for me to learn and apply Java.<br>
If you would like to help me get better at Java or make recommendations and changes to the code, please make a new branch.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Haad Bhutta</p>
